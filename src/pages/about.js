            I've started programming with MATLAB then worked as full stack with
            ASP .NET Web Application. 
            I've also developed a desktop module as developing
            four mathematical models- Fuzzy based and Evolutionary strategy- and
            integrated these models to desktop product to make spatial decision making support system.
