If you want to know how to create a stciky header in your react application, this post is for you. In this post, we are going to do that in a pro way as creating a **[custom hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)** .

### Introduction

On websites, users should see the full content when scrolling down, but they should see the navigation component, that is, the header, when scrolling up. It is very easy to give this experience we just need to know a boolean value whether the user's scroll direction is up or not.

### Final Code

Code for the custom hook and the implementation wiith holy grail layout react application can be found from hereSee an implementation of this custom hook from üëâ [here](https://github.com/definite2/sticky-header-with-hook)

<WarningBodyMessage>
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Even tough you may need urgently a sticky header component in your react app, but I suggest to
  not just copy and paste the code, instead just read this blog and then write it yourself again;
  because this post's main target is not to show how you can create a sticky header, instead it is
  showing you to create it with custom react hook, in a nutshell the emphasis is creating custom
  hook for your UI purposes.

#### Custom Hook

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { off, on } from 'utils'
/**
 * useScrollingUp
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
const useScrollingUp = () => {
  let prevScroll
  //if it is SSR then check you are now on the client and window object is available
  if (process.browser) {
    prevScroll = window.pageYOffset
  }
  const [scrollingUp, setScrollingUp] = useState(false)
  const handleScroll = () => {
    const currScroll = window.pageYOffset
    const isScrolled = prevScroll > currScroll
    setScrollingUp(isScrolled)
    prevScroll = currScroll
  }
  useEffect(() => {
    on(window, 'scroll', handleScroll, { passive: true })
    return () => {
      off(window, 'scroll', handleScroll, { passive: true })
    }
  }, [])
  return scrollingUp
}

export default useScrollingUp
```

If you are going to use this hook for server side rendering, then `window` is not going to be available because our component still not mounted at the client so we can check whether the process is at the client then use `window.pageYOffset`; however if you are going to use for client side rendering with react framework then you don't have to worry about the `if(process.browser)` check.
And we created a boolean state that is `scrollingUp` with _false_ initial value.

We define a variable outside of our callback function as prevScroll which holds vertical pixel value iin other words scrolled amount of pixel that is pageYOffset and it increases with the increasing amount of distance from top to down. The prevScroll, is the value when there is no scroll event whereas currentScroll inside of the callback is the value while scrolling so when user changes direction to scrolling up then the currentScroll will be less than prevScroll because we set its vaue after the comparison so it is still bigger than the currentScroll.

As you see there is a `useEffect` which calls a handler function handleScroll what it does: when the component -which uses this hook- is initially mounted, we add scroll event listener a callback function named handleScroll, with some options, i.e. passive:true option. A more detailed explanation for the hook and callback function

- **prevScroll**: We define a variable outside of our callback function as prevScroll which holds vertical pixel value in other words scrolled amount of pixel that is `pageYOffset` or [scrollY](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pageYOffset). It increases with the increasing amount of distance from top to down, in other words scrolled down.
- **currentScroll**: This variable isinside of the callback that is the `pageYOffset` value while scrolling event occurs.
- üîä Attention and repeating : prevScroll is the value when there is no scroll event whereas currentScroll is the current value while scrolling event.
- Therefore when user changes direction to scrolling up, the currentScroll will be less than prevScroll, after comparison we set prevScroll to the currentScroll.

#### Utils

```js
//exported from src/utils/index.js

export function on(obj, ...args) {
  obj.addEventListener(...args)
}

export function off(obj, ...args) {
  obj.removeEventListener(...args)
}
```

#### Sticky Header

What is we are going to do is just using useScrolingUp hook we set conditional styles to make it sticky.

```js
/**
 * Header
 * @param {object} children is your menu link items
 */
import useScrollingUp from '@/hooks/useScrollingUp'

const Header = ({ children }) => {
  const scrolled = useScrollingUp()
  return <header className={`${scrolled ? 'yourStickyClassName' : ''}`}>{children}</header>
}
export default Header
```

```css
//App.css or App.scss file
header {
  //...the rest is at the source code
  box-shadow: none;
  border: none;
  z-index: 10;
  transition: box-shadow 250ms ease-in-out;
  //..rest
}
.yourStickyClassName {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Conclusion

With this post I want to show that you should not think that react hooks are not solution for only your application's shared logic or state management, but also we can use this fact for managing UI states of our application such as showing a sticky header or showing a scroll to top icon etc.
